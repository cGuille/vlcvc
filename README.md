VLCVC
=====

Add speech recognition to the VLC web interface, in order to command VLC with your voice.

Early stage of development.

Two modules to implementÂ :

### VLC HTTP API
Check out [that file](https://github.com/cGuille/vlcvc/blob/master/vlcvc-plugin/vlc-http-api.js). It is a JS API to send HTTP requests on the VLC HTTP interface.

Command such as "play/pause", "stop" etc. need to be implemented.

### The VLCVC program itself
Check out [that file](https://github.com/cGuille/vlcvc/blob/master/vlcvc-plugin/vlcvc.js).

Listen for audio commands with [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang), then run a corresponding function that call the VLC HTTP API.

### Installation
If VLC is installed on a Ubuntu-like distribution, you can install this plugin by running the following command from the project directory: `npm install`.

It will install everything based on the existing vlc http module in `/usr/share/vlc/lua/http`.

Use `sudo ./uninstall.bash` to uninstall.
